Is there really a new Business Model or Technology that could conceivably have a radical impact on Impact Investing?  
This is NOT just another fundraiser it must be about ideas that could change the whole game  
This is a isms-free zone (debates about the good/bad of socialism, capitalism, etc)  
Long tail economics is a real problem  
Impact Funds (Have a bad name/history)
