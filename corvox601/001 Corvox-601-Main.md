### Emerging Markets, Business Models and Technologies

What is the future of [[001a-impact-investing|lean market investing]]? Is there a new way of doing things out there that will take the world by storm? There is a lot of change happening in the world right with massive problems like global warming, the global pandemics along with  opportunities like new technologies enabling new models for growing businesses.  Maybe instead of watching what the worlds biggest players are doing to adapt to the digital economy it is the small to medium sized players we should be paying attention to. 

The 601 Club has gathered together a world-class group of experts with first-hand knowledge of the issues, barriers and opportunities that are out there and over the past few months we've hosted a vigorous discussion.
